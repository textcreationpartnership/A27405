##Content Summary##

#####Front#####

1. TO THE
READER.

1. The Grounds why Tyths once commanded,
are now denied; as also, why Oaths once
used, are now laid aside.

#####Body#####

1. A brief Declaration of some of the
Oppressions and Sufferings of those people the
World in scorn calls QUAKERS, in the Nothern
parts, who daily suffer the spoyling of their
Goods, and imprisonment of their Persons, by
reason they cannot for conscience sake pay Tythes,
and other customary dues (as they are called) Oblations,
Obversions, Easter-reckonings, Mortuaries,
and such like Popish Inventions; so that they
are daily drawn before the Judgment Seats, and required
to answer the unjust demands of their Accusers,
upon their oathes, thereby endeavouring
to ensnare them, who for conscience sake cannot
swear at all, their souls being made subject to the
Commands of Christ Jesus, who saith, Swear not
at all, but in all your communication let your yea be yea,
and your nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than these,
cometh of evil.
